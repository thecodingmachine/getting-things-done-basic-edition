The "Getting things done" package assumes you will put your classes in the "Test" vendor name (the vendor name is the top level namespace). All your classes should respect the PSR-0 convention. (https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md)

Of course, most of the time, you will not want to use the "Test" vendor name.
To change the vendor name, simply create a new directory instead of the "Test" directory.
Now, we must let Composer know we changed the vendor name, so that it changes the autoloader behaviour.

To do this: edit the composer.json file, and in the "autoload" section, replace "Test" with your own vendor name.
Then, at the command line, go in your project directory and run the command
	php ../composer.phar dumpautoload
